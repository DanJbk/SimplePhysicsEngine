# SimplePhysicsEngine

A simple physics engine using javaFX i made during my second year of college. Expect some commented code and bad code. The project features boxy objects bouncing from each other, Spring and momentum based collision physics and friction. The project has no dependencies. Use the mouse to create objects, WASD to move, I \ O to zoom in and out, click the mouse button to create objects.
