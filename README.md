# SimplePhysicsEngine

A simple physics engine using javaFX that i made during my second year of college. Expect some bad code. The project features boxy objects bouncing from each other, Spring and momentum based collision, friction, and a particle system. The project has no dependencies. Use the mouse to create objects, WASD to move, I and O to zoom in and out, click the mouse button to create objects.
